# dsGeospatial

**Privacy-preserving geospatial visualisation and analysis for health
and environmental data in DataSHIELD**

The goal of dsGeospatial is to …

## Installation

You can install the development version of dsGeospatial from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("FederatedMethods/dsGeospatial")
```

## Overview

**dsGeospatial** is a DataSHIELD package that provides federated methods
for the visualisation and spatial analysis of health and environmental
data while preserving the privacy of individual-level records.

The package has been developed as part of the **GROVE** project within
the **DARE UK** programme, with the aim of enabling secure,
collaborative geospatial analyses across distributed datasets without
transferring sensitive household-level data.

Unlike conventional geospatial workflows, **dsGeospatial** performs all
computations within the secure DataSHIELD environment. Only
non-disclosive summary statistics and visualisations are returned to the
analyst, allowing organisations to collaboratively investigate spatial
patterns and environmental-health relationships while maintaining data
governance and confidentiality.

## Motivation

Many important public health questions require linking health outcomes
with environmental exposures. The package can be used to investigate
questions such as:

- How does asthma prevalence vary with proximity to greenspace?
- Which neighbourhoods have the highest average air pollution exposure?
- Are environmental exposures distributed equally across socio-economic
  groups?
- Can spatial trends be reproduced across multiple organisations without
  sharing household-level data?

The datasets for such research are often held by different organisations
and cannot be combined because of privacy, governance or legal
constraints.

**dsGeospatial** provides a federated analytical framework that enables
these data to be explored safely without exposing household-level
information.

## Features

Current and planned functionality includes:

### Geospatial visualisation

- Heatmaps of region-level summaries
- Choropleth maps - Geographic hotspot identification
- Spatial correlation analysis

### Federated analytics

- Distributed computation across multiple DataSHIELD servers
- Automatic aggregation of study-level results
- Privacy-preserving disclosure controls
- Compatible with Opal, Armadillo and DSLite environments

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(dsGeospatial)
## basic example code
```

## Privacy and disclosure protection

All analyses are performed within the DataSHIELD framework.

No individual-level health or environmental records leave the secure
data repositories. Results returned to the analyst consist only of
disclosure-controlled aggregated outputs that comply with DataSHIELD
disclosure rules.

## Development status

**dsGeospatial** is currently under active development.

Planned future capabilities include: * * \*
